 * Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times.
 * For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
 * [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
 * [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
 * Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time
 * results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
 * Given the sorted rotated array that may contain duplicates,
 * return the minimum element of this array.
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
