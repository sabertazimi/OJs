 * The next greater element of some element x in an array
 * is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.
 * You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2,
 * where nums1 is a subset of nums2.
 * For each 0 <= i < nums1.length,
 * find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j]
 * and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2.
 * If there is no next greater element,
 * then the answer for this query is -1.
 * Return an array ans of length nums1.length
 * such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.
