 * Winter is coming! During the contest,
 * your first job is to design a standard heater
 * with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
 * Every house can be warmed,
 * as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.
 * Given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line,
 * return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.
 * Notice that all the heaters follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.
